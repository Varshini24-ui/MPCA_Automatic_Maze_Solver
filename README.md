This project implements a maze-solving line-following robot using an Arduino microcontroller.
It is designed to navigate through a black line maze using infrared (IR) sensors and make decisions at intersections based on a right-hand or left-hand wall-following algorithm.

Hardware Requirements :
1. Arduino Uno / Nano

2. 5 IR sensors (line sensors)

3. L298N or L293D motor driver

4. 2 DC motors with wheels

5. Chassis for the robot

6. Power supply (Battery Pack â€“ 7.4V or 9V)

7. Jumper wires
